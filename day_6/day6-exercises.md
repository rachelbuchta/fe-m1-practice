## Chapter 3

1. entering `sayHello` prints the function and entering `sayHello()` calls the function and passes arguments through the parameters.

2. parameters are the items that appear inside the parantheses of the function that act like variable names. Arguments are the values you specify in the parantheses when you call the function. Arguments can be provided as values or as variables.

 3. The return value is used to return a value to the code that called the function.

 4. Local variables are better than global variables because they require less memory as the browser only has to remember them during the period of time that the function is being executed and has less risk of naming conflicts.
