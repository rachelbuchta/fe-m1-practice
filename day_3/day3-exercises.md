## Chapter 13 and 15

1.
* Border - A border seperates the edges of one box from another. Every box has a border even if it is not visible.
* Margin - Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of 2 adjacent boxes.
* Padding - This is the space between the border of a box and any content containted within it.

2. 1px = top, 2px = right, 5px = bottom, 10 px = left.

3. A block level will always create a new line after and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text.

4. The role of fixed positioning is used to keep the element in the same position in the browser even when the user scrolls. Using the z-index is important when using fixed position because it allows you to control which element sits ontop and prevents boxes from overlapping.

5. A fixed layout design does not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser. The liquid layout stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser.
